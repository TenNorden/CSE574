# CSE5742018

This repository consist of the projects I have completed as part of CSE574 2018 machine Learning course at SUNY University at Buffalo.

I have used googlecolab TPU to run my codes because of the large datasets. The processing time might get very lengthy for some of the projects if you use regular personal computer.
